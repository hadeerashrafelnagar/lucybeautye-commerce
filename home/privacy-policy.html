          <p>hey provide us with the online e-commerce platform that allows us to sell our products and services to
            you.Your data is stored through Shopify’s data storage, databases and the general Shopify application. They
            store your data on a secure server behind a firewall.Payment:If you choose a direct payment gateway to
            complete your purchase, then Shopify stores your credit card data. It is encrypted through the Payment Card
            Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Your purchase transaction data is stored only as long as is
            necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction
            information is deleted.All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the
            PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express
            and Discover.PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store
            and its service providers.For more insight, you may also want to read Shopify’s Terms of Service here or
